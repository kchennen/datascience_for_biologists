### Directory
  - A *folder* on your computer which contains files. UNIX filesystems are organized as hierarchical directories. 
  - Forward slashes divide levels in the nested hierarchy of directories, e.g. `/top_level_directory/second_level_directory`
  - The directory at the top of this hierarchy is called the **root** directory and is denoted simply as `/`. 

### Path
  - The *address* to a directory or file on your computer. There are, generally, two types of paths:
    - **Absolute/full path** represents the path of a given directory/file beginning at the root directory.
    - **Relative path** represents the path of a given directory/file relative to the working/current directory.
